# slices.yaml
# This file defines the network slices for the SDN slicing controller.
# Each slice specifies its flows, guaranteed bandwidth (as a percentage of link capacity), and priority.

# Slice for Gaming traffic
gaming:
  flows:
    - {src: g1, dst: gs}      # Flow from host g1 to host gs
  capacity_pct: 60            # Reserve 60% of the link capacity for this slice
  priority: 50                # Priority level for admission control

# Slice for Work traffic
work:
  flows:
    - {src: h1, dst: h5}      # Flow from host h1 to host h5
  capacity_pct: 20            # Reserve 20% of the link capacity for this slice
  priority: 50                # Priority level for admission control

# Slice for Emergency traffic
emergency:
  flows:
    - {src: ps, dst: h3}      # Flow from host ps to host h3
  capacity_pct: 20            # Reserve 20% of the link capacity for this slice
  priority: 100               # Higher priority for emergency traffic

# New slice to test bandwidth conflicts
video:
  flows:
    - {src: h2, dst: gs}      # Flow from host h2 to host gs
  capacity_pct: 50            # Reserve 50% of the link capacity for this slice
  priority: 30                # Lower priority for this slice
