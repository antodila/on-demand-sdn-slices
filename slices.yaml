# slices.yaml
# defines network slices for the SDN slicing controller
# each slice has flows, a reserved bandwidth %, and a priority level

# Gaming slice
gaming:
  flows:
    - {src: g1, dst: gs}      # g1 → gs (goes through s1 → s4)
  capacity_pct: 60            # gets 60% of the link
  priority: 50                # medium priority

# Work slice
work:
  flows:
    - {src: h1, dst: h5}      # h1 → h5 (goes through s1 → s2 → s5)
  capacity_pct: 20            # gets 20% of the link
  priority: 50                # medium priority

# Emergency slice
emergency:
  flows:
    - {src: h1, dst: gs}      # h1 → gs (goes through s1 → s4)
  capacity_pct: 50            # gets 50% of the link
  priority: 100               # highest priority

# Video slice
video:
  flows:
    - {src: h2, dst: gs}      # h2 → gs (goes through s1 → s4)
  capacity_pct: 50            # gets 50% of the link
  priority: 30                # low priority
