# slices.yaml
# This file defines the network slices for the SDN slicing controller.
# Each slice specifies its flows, guaranteed bandwidth (as a percentage of link capacity), and priority.

# Slice for Gaming traffic
gaming:
  flows:
    - {src: g1, dst: gs}      # Flow from host g1 to host gs (path: s1 -> s4)
  capacity_pct: 60            # Reserve 60% of the link capacity
  priority: 50                # Medium priority

# Slice for Work traffic
work:
  flows:
    - {src: h1, dst: h5}      # Flow from host h1 to host h5 (path: s1 -> s2 -> s5)
  capacity_pct: 20            # Reserve 20% of the link capacity
  priority: 50                # Medium priority

# Slice for Emergency traffic
emergency:
  flows:
    - {src: h1, dst: gs}      # Flow from host h1 to gs (path: s1 -> s4)
  capacity_pct: 50            # Reserve 50% of the link capacity
  priority: 100               # Highest priority

# Slice for Video traffic
video:
  flows:
    - {src: h2, dst: gs}      # Flow from host h2 to gs (path: s1 -> s4)
  capacity_pct: 50            # Reserve 50% of the link capacity
  priority: 30                # Low priority
